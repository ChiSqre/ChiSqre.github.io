# Andrew Farell — Personal Website

Static site built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Designed for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start

1. Replace `assets/Andrew_Farell_Resume.pdf` with your actual resume PDF (keep the same name or update the link in `index.html`).
2. Edit text in `index.html` as needed (About, Specialties, Experience).
3. Push to GitHub and enable Pages (Settings → Pages → from branch).

## Local preview

Just open `index.html` in a browser, or use a static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
